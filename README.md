## Code Overview

This code generates, simulates, and analyzes ceRNA networks. It can generate many different types of ceRNA networks, and
can easily be extended to generate more. It can simulate the networks exactly using the Gillespie algorithm (implemented
by the StochPy library), and using a numerical solution to a mean field approximation.
